# Tokens used for FNChoose() and FNchoose_no_string_lookup(). They should
# always come in pairs, the choices being second. The translated choice
# letters should be in the same order as their english equivalents in the
# token, as the program indexes into the translated choice letters.
# So for instance "(Long/Short/None)" in french might be "(Rien/Petit/Grand)"
# which is re-ordered, but the choices line following it would have to
# be "LSN:GPR". This is not actually a restriction, as the choices string
# is never printed. It is simply used to validate key presses and to translate
# to the english choices and defaults used by the program.
