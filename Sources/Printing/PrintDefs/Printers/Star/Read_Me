The following table shows which printer definition
file to use with which Star printer, together with
a brief indication of the DIP switch or control
panel settings needed on the printer:

The StarJet SJ-48 inkjet printer may alternatively
be used with the IBM.Pro-X24E file if the DIP
switches are set for IBM emulation mode (switch 1
OFF). However, all resolutions above 180 by 180
dpi will be interlaced whereas using Epson mode
and the Canon.BJC-800 file gives full 360 by 360
dpi non interlaced.

The LaserPrinter 4, 4III and 8, 8III StarScript
options can be used with Postscript files as well
as HP files.

The "Star.DP-510" printer definition file is for
the Star DP-510 printer. The maximum vertical
resolution is specified in multiples of 1/144 inch 
using ESC "3" on this printer (instead of the
usual 1/216 inch) and so vertical interlacing is
limited to two passes (144 dpi resolution). ISO
Latin 1 text characters are obtained using the
unusual range of top bit set characters available
on this printer, plus some use of backspace
over-printing and some use of Epson standard ESC
"R" international character set selections. There
is no use of double strike mode (ESC "G" and ESC
"H") or superscripts and subscripts (ESC "S" and
ESC "T") as there are some problems with this
printer which make these features difficult if not
impossible to use reliably.

For the Star DP-510 DIP switch 3 must be OFF
(select 8 bit interface) and DIP switch 4 must be
OFF (no auto line feed on carriage return). In the
unlikely event that you need auto line feed set to
ON, then you can use !PrintEdit to remove the
trailing ",10" from the "Line skip:", "Line end
1:" and "Line end 2:" fields in all the graphics
resolutions.

The "Star.LC-200" printer definition file is for
the Star LC-200 Colour printer in standard
emulation (EDS A-1 ON) and other similar Star 9
pin printers. The graphics definitions are the
same as the Epson.EX-800 file. The text
definitions are the same as the Epson.LQ-860 file,
except that the LC-200's ability to select IBM
Code Page 850 (Multi-lingual) is used to print ISO
Latin 1 top bit set characters. The Legal
international character set (ESC "R" 64) is also
used. You should not attempt to print in colour
unless your printer has a colour ribbon installed.
Please see the Epson.Read_Me file for comments
about printing in colour at interlaced resolutions
(above 120 by 72 DPI).

The "Star.LC24-200" printer definition file is for
the Star LC24-200 Colour printer in standard
emulation (EDS A-1 ON) and other similar Star 24
pin printers. The graphics definitions are the
same as the Epson.LQ-860 file. The text
definitions are also the same as the Epson.LQ-860
file, except that the LC24-200's ability to select
IBM Code Page 850 (Multi-lingual) is used to print
ISO Latin 1 top bit set characters. The Legal
international character set (ESC "R" 64) is also
used. You should not attempt to print in colour
unless your printer has a colour ribbon installed.
Please see the Epson.Read_Me file for comments
about printing in colour at interlaced resolutions
(above 180 by 180 DPI).

The "Star.SJ-144" printer definition file is for
use with the Star SJ-144 Colour printer. It
consists of the graphics support from the
Canon.BJC-800 file and the text support from the
Star.LC24-200 file. The SJ-144 printer does work
with the BJC-800 or BJC-600 files, but with the
SJ-144 file you get better character mappings due
to selecting Code Page 850 for top bit set
characters.
