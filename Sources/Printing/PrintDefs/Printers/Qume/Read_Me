Read_Me file for Qume printers.
-------------------------------

The definition file in the Qume directory is for a
Qume ScripTEN printer.

If you have a Qume CrystalPrint Publisher, the
same definition file can be used, but it is
possible that problems may be experienced with
early versions of the CrystalPrint in two areas:

1. The timing of their Centronics interface was
not always compatible

2. The PostScript '#Copies' command was not
supported.

Discussions with Qume confirmed that a new version
of the firmware in the Qume CrystalPrint was
needed. The problems have been fixed and you can
obtain a free of charge upgrade of the firmware
for your printer directly from Qume. Their address
and telephone number is:

Qume Ltd
Bridgewater Close
Reading
Berkshire
RG3 1JT

Tel: 0734 584646

You should quote details including serial number
of the printer.
