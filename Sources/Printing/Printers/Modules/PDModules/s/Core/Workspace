;       string is 256 - hence the size defined here.
; Note that these uses do not conflict with each other: VDU 5 characters
; are always flushed to the printer as soon as any other plotting operation
; comes along.
;   Furthermore, this buffer is overlaid on the persistent error buffer: this
; is safe because once a persistent error has occurred, nothing more can
