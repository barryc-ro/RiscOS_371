;; 30-Aug-91 DDV 3.18 Intergrated with new core files - new ColourTrans_SelectTable functions
;;  5-Aug-91 DDV 3.19 Fatality flag specified on abortjob calls to the back end - stiff after first page  
;; 11-Sep-91 DDV      Bug fix: ColourTrans_SelectTable now works when reading palette for mode
;; 11-Sep-91 DDV 3.20 Bug fix: font slaving problems
;; -------------------------------- RISC OS 3.00 release version ---------------------------

;; 22-Oct-91 DDV      Bug fix: Removing a PDumper works correctly

;; 24-Oct-91 DDV      Adding a duplicate PDumper module is now trapped correctly
;; 24-Oct-91 DDV 3.23 When removing a PDumper module we now check the job list to see if the dumper is being used     
;; 27-Oct-91 DDV 3.24 Improved dumper register code
;; 10-Dec-91 SMC 3.25 Shortened message tokens
;;  3-Mar-92 DDV      Updated handling of ColourTrans requests
;; 16-Mar-92 DDV      Bug fix: sprite scaling so that it works with large sprites
;; 17-Mar-92 DDV 3.26 PutSpriteGreyScaled no longer supported - plots scaled instead
;; 18-Mar-92 DDV      Bug fix: Palette corruption after printing multi-page documents
;; 19-Mar-92 DDV 3.27 Bug fix: Left / Top margins adjusted to include the print border
;; 31-Mar-92 DDV 3.28 Bug fix: service reset corrupting registers
;; 30-Oct-92 SAH 3.29 PDriver_SelectJob (+Illustration) corrupted R7.  (Core.SWIs).
;; 02-Aug-93 PAH 4.00 Incorporated SAH Changes to add support for LIBRA1
;; 14-Sep-93 PAH 4.01 fixed black border bug - maybe!
;; 05-Oct-93 SAH 4.02 Bugfix: use stringwidth (not bounding box) when calculating justification
;;                      offsets.  This is because the bounding box returned by Font_ScanString
;;                      does not include the distance moved by 'move' control sequences at the
;;                      start and end of the string.
;; 15-Oct-93 PAH 4.03 Bugfix: Medusa Printing is much slower - Behaviour of wimp_claimFreeMemory
;;                      has changed, it no longer returns the max ammount of mem. available,
;;                      temporary work around fix.
;; 02-Nov-93 PAH 4.04 Bugfix: Printing in mono/landscape can result in noise at the top of the
;;                      page
;;                    Bugfix: Pressing escape on Medusa could lead to strange error messages,
;;                      this was because the error buffer (part of the job's ws) was freed before
;;                      the message is displayed (In accordance with PRM). Unfortunately 
;;                      the new error module then overwrites this bit of memory.
;; 16-Nov-93 PAH 4.05 Bugfix: Pdriver_setInfo would cause error if colour is set
;;                    Work-around:  abort_job clears output stream - stop's pages being printed
;;                      when background printing escaped.
;; 30-Nov-93 SAH 4.06 Bugfix: the option to pass the initial font handle in via R0
;;                      did not work because it got corrupted before it was used.
;; 30-Nov-93 PAH 4.07 Bugfix: Printing large/wide sprites would cause incorrect rectangle values
;;                      to be passed to SpriteExtend. Also affected printing from different modes!
;;                    Bugfix: Printer to error diffused could crash 'cos all the memory had been
;;                      allocated
;;  8-Dec-93 PAH 4.08 Bugfix: fixed 2nd stage of jumble error messages when pressing escape
;; 14-Jan-94 PAH 4.09 Bugfix: not capable of printing more than one page, incorrectly calling 
;;                      PdumperAbortJob
;; 19-Jan-94 PAH 4.10 Bugfix: plot sprites that have a divisor of 1 in the scale factor, were
;;                      causing the spirte_put code to freeze due to division by zero
;; 19-Jan-94 JSR 4.11 Up version number only - change was in MakeFile install dependancy
;; 20-Jan-94 PAH 4.12 Bugfix: Printer name was lost if PdriverInfo was called in middle of
;;                      job
;; 01-Feb-94 PAH 4.13 Bugfix: Colourtrans_selecttable only behaves differently with R5 bit 4
;;                      set when source is either 16 or 32bpp
;; 03-Feb-94 PAH 4.14 Bugfix: Take into account that wimp_claimfreememory now returns all the 
;;                      memory available to it
;; 16-Feb-94 PAH 4.15 Bugfix: Aborting a job by pressing escape would leave the printer in a
;;                      confused state.
;;                    Bugfix: Going from TrueColour to old sprites requires numourous 32K tables
;;                      to be generated - ensure there is enough space in RMA before 
;;                      Wimp_ClaimFreeMemory tries to grab it all.
;; 18-Feb-94 SAH 4.16 Stopped Core routines masking out bit 4 of R5 on entry to sprite
;;                      plotting SWIs.  This bit gets passed through to SpriteExtend where
;;                      it means "use the sprite's palette in preference to the translation
;;                      table".
;; 24-Feb-94 PAH 4.17 Bugfix: MED-03014. Printing 2up landscape from impression would crash
;;                      - cause was handle16/32bpp_rotation looping once too much.
;; 03-Mar-94 PAH 4.18 Bugfix: Thought minimum amount of memory required for internal strip
;;                      buffers was 4 times for 16million and 2 times for 32 thousand
;; 09-May-94 AMG 4.19 Bugfix: (Core) Don't use bignum as default terminator to string in
;;                      intercepted font_paint - caused immediate termination if string to
;;                      be printed was in rma on a Risc PC (rma is at &02100000 but bignum
;;                      is only &02000000)
;; 12-Sep-94 AMcC 4.21 Version is now set in shared Version file (version number now in
;;                       line with SrcFile).
;; 13-Sep-94 MJS  4.22 Changes for JPEG plot support
;; 30-Sep-94 MJS  4.23 More JPEG changes - rectangle pre-scan to calculate JPEG memory
;; 21-Oct-94 MJS  4.24 Support for wide translation tables on Sprite plot
;; 25-Oct-94 MJS  4.25 Footling change - use proper global symbols for JPEG SWI's
;; 17-Nov-94 MJS  4.27 Bug fix - make sure 'not enough memory' error is not ignored in the
;;                     case where rectangle pre-scan allowed (OOPS! caused a machine crash).
;;                     Also, make sure any error diffusion buffer is freed on such error.
;; 23-Nov-94 MJS  4.28 Refuse to initialise if PDriver not active - ie. be dormant in ROM,
;;                     provided PDriver is later in chain. Change JPEG allocation to cater
;;                     for SPriteExtend now using dynamic area (not RMA). Try to allow up
;;                     to 1/16 of total memory free (eg. for complicated Draw path). Shrink
;;                     SpriteArea after allocation to fit whole number of strips (free wastage).
;; 25-Nov-94 MJS  4.29 Give proper error message if PDriver not active
;; 01-Dec-94 MJS  4.30 Fix bug with 16-bit colour depth, landscape, odd no. of rows in strip
;;                     (eg. possible with Epson Stylus Colour PDF)
;; 06-Jan-95 MJS  4.31 Fix bug with PDriver_AbortJob corrupting R4 (MED-04280)
;; 03-Mar-95 MJS  4.33 Fix MED-04626 (deep sprites -> grey not gamma corrected)
;; 10-Jul-95 MJS  4.37 Make sure strip sprite is a multiple of 8 pixels wide (may be assumed
;;                     by newer, faster code in PdumperSpt, pdumpers). Respond to (seteval'd)
;;                     numeric system var PDriverDPMaxMem, if present, to set max memory in
;;                     Mbytes to be used for strip sprite.
