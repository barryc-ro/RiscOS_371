OSLib release 4.8
----- ------- ---
 * Added the capability for more help text. Help text will be slowly
added as it becomes apparent how best to do it.

 * Added Toolbox SWI's. Now there are (well) over 77 headers, split the
lot into 4 parts and added SetVars to the distribution. After running
it, use -IOS: on the cc command to pick up the headers, and link with
OSLib:o.OSLib.

 * Added CD, CDFS, thanks to Simon Middleton of Uniqueway.

 * Fixed many Toolbox files based on an extensive going-over by Simon
Middleton.

 * Added SCSI, SCSIFS.

 * Added WindowSupportExternal, fixed some faults in Window, Toolbox
(thanks to that Simon again).

 * Corrected OSArgs_SetAllocation.

 * Added some help text.

OSLib release 4.7
----- ------- ---
 * Added Freeway and ShareFS.

 * Added *lots* of new type names, most of which are defined as |int| or
|bits|, and added 'Values:' section to StrongHelp on types. (See, e g,
|wimp_colour|.) In most cases, this allows you in a single click to see
all the values that are allowed in a given argument position. For
example, given the prototype for os_read_mode_variable(), you can find out
the names of the legal mode variables. Moved some filing system contants
into FileSwitch to support this.

 * Turned more output arguments into return values, for efficiency
reasons (mostly in OS, ColourTrans).

 * Added socket SWI's.

 * Added 16-bit Sound SWI's.

 * Added osbyte(), osbyte1(), osbyte2() for the useful special cases of
OS_Bytes that take 3 arguments and return no result, or a result in R1
or R2.

 * Added ColourTrans_ReturnWideEntries, OSSpriteOp_GivenWideEntries.

 * Corrected dosfs_layout_structure(), added dosfs_layout_structure_-
given_size().

 * Name change for 2 OSSpriteOp flags words, which were confusing (now
osspriteop_DESTINATION_COORDS, osspriteop_SOURCE_RECTANGLE).

 * Removed more spaces around # in C headers.

 * Buffer_InternalId returned by Buffer_InternalInfo.

 * ADFSDiscOp_FormatTrack takes a FileCore_TrackFormat, not a
FileCore_Format.

 * Fixed bug in NetFS_SetObject types (operation type was not present).

OSLib release 4.6
----- ------- ---

 * Add |const| qualifiers in places where they are valid, i e, where the
function takes a pointer to an object which it does not use to modify
the object.

 * Made |filecore_disc_record| 4 bytes longer, since filecore_describe_-
disc() fills in 64 bytes.

 * Changed int to char [4] in NetFS to avoid alignment problems.

 * Added OS_ChangedBoxState constants.

 * Moved most of the macros in "types.h" into a new "macros.h."

 * Added mode flags bits.

 * Corrected name of ColourTrans_ReadPalette's output argument: |spare|
not |used|.

 * At this point, the RISC O S interface provided by OSLib consists of

       2122 symbolic constants
        461 error numbers
         16 event functions
         78 message numbers
        103 service call functions
        983 swi functions (each in x and non-x form)
        355 types
         25 upcall functions
         36 vector functions

in 68 header files.

 * Changed workspace from |byte *| to |void *| (for consistency) in
ColourPicker and CompressJPEG. (|Buffer| should never be |const|;
|workspace| should always be |void *|; |handle| should always be |int|.)

 * PaletteV_{Read,Write}Entries argument changed to |os_colour_number *|
from |int *|.

OSLib release 4.5
----- ------- ---

 * Added SWI's MessageTrans_Dictionary, Joystick_ReadHalfWord,
Joystick_CalibrateTopLeft, Joystick_CalibrateBottomRight, PDriver_JPEGSWI.

 * Added modules JPEG, CompressJPEG, Portable.

 * Corrected WimpTextOp flags.

 * Added type OSFile_InfoWords, useful for converting load and exec
addresses into date and time.

 * Corrected NetFS_DoFSOpToGivenFS.

 * Added Wimp_GivenWindowAndIcon for Wimp_GetMenuState.

 * Added ColourPicker_DialogueIgnoreKeyPressed and
ColourPicker_UpdateIgnoreKeyPressed.

OSLib release 4.4 (RISC O S 3.6 compatible)
----- ------- --- ----- - - --- -----------

 * Added |pdriver_FEATURE_DRAW_PAGE_FLAGS| and changed type of
|pdriver_draw_page| first argument to |bits| for JPEG support.

 * Added osspriteop_verify_area().

 * (*Experimetal*) Use inline SWI's where possible: 252 out of 2429 SWI
veneers happen to be A P C S-conformant, and may be replaced by single
SWI instructions in the caller. Only supported by Norcroft C release 5,
but enabled by default: IF YOU ARE NOT USING NORCROFT C RELEASE 5 OR
LATER, you must disable the feature by using the -D__swi option on the
compiler command line (e g, 

      cc -D__swi c.progfile

with a hyphen, a capital 'D', 2 underscores, and 'swi' in lower case).
The reason this feature is experimental is that the relevant flavour of
A P C S requires that function calls should preserve flags, which is not
guaranteed (an inlinable SWI will always be an x-clear SWI, and will
therefore definitely clear V). If this is a problem in practice, the
feature will be reviewed.

 * Added new serial baud rates for RO 3.5 to "osserialop.h."

 * Changed copyright notice and deleted OS-specific references (e g, to
P R M) to make DefMod more applicable to 3rd party modules.

 * Corrected output argument of OS_GSTrans.

 * upcall_sleep() returns |claimed| as its result, not in an output
argument.

 * Change nested-inclusion method in assembler headers to allow faster
assembly.

 * Added more wimp version symbols. Recommended use is

      if ((e = xwimpreadsysinfo_version (&version)) != NULL)
      {  if (e->errnum == error_WIMP_BAD_SYS_INFO)
            version = wimp_VERSION_RO2;
         else
            os_generate_error (e);
      }

      if (version >= wimp_VERSION_RO35)
         version = wimp_VERSION_RO35;
               /*or any larger version you "know" about*/
      else if (version >= wimp_VERSION_RO3)
         version = wimp_VERSION_RO3;
      else if (version >= wimp_VERSION_RO30)
         version = wimp_VERSION_RO30;

      wimp_initialise (version, programme, messages, NULL, &task);

or the equivalent. This is the result of past bugs: versions of the Wimp
after 350 will accept all versions numbers quite happily.

 * Added type |os_error_handler_buffer|.

OSLib release 4.3
----- ------- ---

 * Added dependency of "dragasprite.h" on "osspriteop.h."

 * |#Undef|fed each SWI name and SWI reason code before |#define|ing it.

 * Removed spurious ')' in comment for OS_SetPalette.

 * Changed names of arguments to Wimp_SetIconState.

 * SWI Wimp_Extend given the right number (but it's reserved anyway).

 * Added os_read_line_given_echo(), os_read_line_suppress_invalid(),
os_read_line_given_echo_suppress_invalid().

 * Changed filetypes, load addrs, exec addrs and attrs to |bits| from |int|
(to avoid undefined behaviour when shifting bits in and out of load and
exec addrs). Affects "filecore.h," "filer.h," "fileraction.h,"
"netfs.h," "osfile.h," "osfscontrol.h," "osgbpb.h," "osmodule.h,"
"pdriver.h," "resourcefs.h," "squash.h," "wimp.h."

 * Corrected osfile_TYPE and osfile_TYPE_SHIFT.

 * Changed ColourPicker button types to |bits| from |int|.

 * Added OSFile attribute values.

 * Do not truncate file names at 10 characters in nested includes (as
recommended in my own documentation!). Affects "pdriver.h" only.

 * Avoid C++ reserved words (asm, template in "os.h," delete in "netfs.h").

 * Remove accidentally duplicated parameter names ("dosfs.h,"
"filecore.h," "font.h," "osspriteop.h," "pdriver.h," "ramfs.h,"
"sharedclibrary.h") to avoid GCC errors.

 * Added flags values for osspriteop_set_pointer_shape().

 * Output argument of wimpreadsysinfo_tool_sprites() corrected (was
|osspriteop_area *|, should be |osspriteop_area **|).

 * Various changes to ReadMe, including description of "abstract types."

 * Changed definition of |os_date_and_time| from 

      typdef struct {byte b [5];} os_date_and_time;

to 

      typedef byte os_date_and_time [5];

and the same for |netfs_date_and_time|. This may break code, but it is
necessary to ensure that the alignment of structures that use it (e g,
|osgbpb_system_info|) are correct in Norcroft C (which aligns
structures, but not arrays, to word boundaries).

 * Added chip-type symbols to "osreadsysinfo.h."

 * Fixed minor typos in "devicefs.h," "netfs.h," "osfscontrol.h."

 * Added CMOS byte numbers for current year and alarm flags ("osbyte.h")
and also recoded the macros in there to make it totally complete and
consistent for all CMOS locations.

 * Corrected SWI numbers for FSLock, added error numbers.

OSLib release 4.2
----- ------- ---

 * Fixed bug in ADFS_DiscOp, FileCore_DiscOp, RamFS_DiscOp: first argument
was being passed in R0, not R1.

 * Provided 3 functions for Territory_ReadSymbols, so you can call the right
one for the type of result expected.

 * Changed the tag used for "abstract" typedefs so that it is different from
the typedef name, for better interworking with GCC and C++ systems. Affects
"buffer.h," "colourpicker.h," "devicefs.h," "dma.h," "econet.h," "os.h,"
"osfscontrol.h," "osspriteop.h," "wimp.h."

 * Added wimp_CLOSE_MENU (to be used as an argument to wimp_create_menu())
and wimp_NO_FONTS (to be used as an argument to wimp_load_template()) to
"wimp.h."

 * Fixed bug in Filer_MessageOpenDirAt: display field was bits, not byte.

OSLib release 4.1
----- ------- ---

 * Wimpreadsysinfo_wimp_mode() returns |os_mode| rather than |int|.

 * Fix bug: some byte-wide entities were being written as whole words. This
affects: xcolourtrans_return_gcol(), xcolourtrans_set_gcol(), xcolourtrans_-
return_gcol_for_mode(), xcolourtrans_return_opp_gcol(), xcolourtrans_set_-
opp_gcol(), xcolourtrans_return_opp_gcol_for_mode(), xcolourtrans_colour_-
number_to_gcol(), xcolourtrans_set_text_colour(), xcolourtrans_set_opp_-
text_colour(), xfont_find_font(), xfont_current_font(), font_current_-
font(), xfont_future_font(), font_future_font(), xfont_current_rgb(), xfont_-
future_rgb(), xos_read_point(), os_read_point(), xos_change_redirection(),
os_change_redirection(), xosfind_openin(), xosfind_openout(), xosfind_-
openup(), xosspriteop_read_pixel_colour(), osspriteop_read_pixel_colour(),
xpdriver_select_job(), xpdriver_current_job(), xpdriver_select_-
illustration(), xwimpreadsysinfo_font(), wimpreadsysinfo_font(),
xwimpspriteop_read_pixel_colour(), wimpspriteop_read_pixel_colour().

 * Add note to ReadMe file about using NULL pointers as output arguments.

 * Duplicate NOP macro deleted from Hdr.Types.

 * Added OS_VartypeLiteralString, os_VARTYPE_LITERAL_STRING to OS headers.

 * Corrected Wimp error numbers (most were 1 off), added Error_WimpBadSlot,
Error_WimpBadConfFont, Error_WimpNoSprites, Error_WimpBadPalFile2,
Error_WimpBadSprites from RO 3.5, and 2 now-obsolete numbers (too many
windows, division by 0).

OSLib release 4
----- ------- -

 * Second public release

 * Changed 'allpication' to 'application' in os.h (!).

 * Os_change_environment() now returns the old handler.

 * Error_SQUASH_BADPARAMETERS gains an underscore.

 * In osmodule.h, "context" arguments given more meaningful names
(|module_no|, |instance_no|). Various osmodule_enumerate() calls return
|module_no_out| as the result.

 * Added help files for StrongHelp, available on F1 in StrongEd (by
default), and also in Zap C Mode if you bind MJE_HELPCONTEXT to F1 in the
keys file.

 * Added OS_PlotVDU, changed argument types of OS_ChangeRedirection.

 * Fix bug: size of unions was being specified as 0 in assembler headers.

 * Added stuff about "types.h" in ReadMe.

 * Restructured: OSLib now contains only ChangeLog, ReadMe, h, Hdr and o.
Separate archives contain Examples (PRM example code in C), CStrong
(StrongHelp for the C interface) and CHelp (SrcEdit help for the C
interface). A future release will contain AsmStrong and AsmHelp (for the
assembler interface).

OSLib release 3
----- ------- -

 * Provide ReadMe and this file with the release.

 * Added descriptive text to each function.

 * "Abstract" types supported: used for Wimp_W, Wimp_T, Econet_RxCB,
Econet_TxCB, etc.

 * IIC_Control, OS_Byte, OS_ClaimScreenMemory, Wimp_ClaimFreeMemory now
classified as "reason codes."

 * Incorporated suggestions from Jonathan Roach for filecore.h.

 * Fix bug: bad code generated for Font_CacheAddr, Font_ReadDefn,
Font_ReadScaleFactor, OSFSControl_ReadFileType, PDriver_PageSize,
WimpSpriteOp_ReadPaletteSize and WimpSpriteOp_ReadSpriteSize.

 * Use |void| (instead of |byte|) for generic pointers, where appropriate.

 * Added more error numbers.

 * Renamed International as ServiceInternational.

 * Upgrade to RISC OS 3.5.

 * Added more message types to filer.h.

 * If there is a reasonable |context_out| argument, return it from the non-X
form.

 * Moved "main" SWI's to their own headers (OS_Byte to osbyte.h, etc), InsV,
RemV, CnpV to Buffer.

 * Sorted all OS SWI's into one of these groups: the CLI; communications;
conversions; the environment; errors; input; interrupts; memory management;
output; time and date; VDU drivers; vectors; and the rest of the kernel.
Maybe os.h, which is somewhat monolithic, should be split up along these
lines?

 * Added RemV, CnpV, but not properly yet.

OSLib release 2
----- ------- -

 * Now complete. All calls up to RISC OS 3.10 are included. (Medusa
extensions will have to wait until the next release.)

 * In the header files, registers which are assigned fixed values in a
function veneer (e g, reason codes) are listed in an 'Other notes'
paragraph.

 * The section header (e g, for 'Constant definitions,' etc) is absent if the
section is absent. The section headers are more eye-catching. (Suggested by
James Bye.)

 * More SWI's return results in their non-X form.

 * Result registers are no longer in the argument list. In the previous
OSLib, the prototype for |osmodule_alloc()| (which allocates memory from the
R M A) was

      void osmodule_alloc (int size, byte **ptr);

now it is

      byte *osmodule_alloc (int size);

Also: OSFile functions return the object type; functions that create an
object or open a file return the handle; SWI's that do a read operation
return the flags, so you can write

      while ((os_bget (f, &c) & _C) == NONE)
      {  ... code to do something with character |c| ...;
      }
      ... now at end of file ...;

Econet SWI's return the control block created, or the status of the operation
performed; WIMP and PDriver SWI's that are called to loop through rectangles
return the continuation status, so you can write a redraw loop as

      for (more = wimp_redraw_window (&r); more;
            more = wimp_get_rectangle (&r))
      {  ... redraw code here ...;
      }

 * More consistent terminology: SWI's that fill buffers have two arguments,
usually called |buffer| and |size|, and may return one of: a pointer to the
next free byte (always called |end|); a number of bytes written (called
|used|); or a count of buffer bytes not used (called |spare|). More
consistency could only be derived by changing the OS, or doing some bizarre
things in the veneer.

 * More of the module interface described: vectors, upcalls and events
added, with prefix |os_...v|, |upcall_| and |event_| respectively. Error
prefix changed to |error_|. Message prefix still |message_|, service call
prefix |service_|. All other symbols defined in a module begin with the
module prefix. Service calls and all the above now at the end. (These are
only provided from the implementor's side, as it were: functions to generate
the event, call the vector, make the service call, rather than to act on the
event, claim the vector, or catch the service call.)

 * In the header files, C syntax is used for hexadecimal in comments.

 * In the header files, brackets removed from pointer declarations.
(Suggested by James Bye.)

 * Spurious blank lines removed from header files.

 * To get -1 into a register Rx, used to generate the stupid MOV Rx, #&FF:
ORR Rx, Rx, #&FF00: ORR Rx, Rx, #&FF0000: ORR Rx, Rx, #&FF00000. Now
generates MVN Rx, #0 instead, and similarly for similar constants.

 * Assumes that a non-X SWI will never be called in SVC mode. This means that
LR is preserved over the SWI instruction and reduces quite a lot of veneers
to 2 instructions.

 * Uses that fact that registers not corrupted or returned by the SWI are
preserved, to avoid stacking output addresses where possible. This also
reduces the lengths and memory accesses of a lot of veneers. (Suggested by
James Bye.)

 * OSFind changed: instead of (e g) 

      xosfind_openout_path (flags, file_name, path, file);

use

      xosfind_openout (osfind_PATH | flags, file_name, path, file);

In other words, the choice between {default path, no path, given path, path
variable} is moved from the function name to the flags argument. (Suggested
by Ian Johnson) Sadly, this cannot be done with the OSFile SWI's, because
they are not related in a systematic way.

 * One library (o.OSLib) instead of lots. (Suggested by Kevin Welton.)

 * All code examples from the PRM (except volume 4) included in C versions.

OSLib release 1
----- ------- -

 * Name changed from SWILib. DefMod written to provide an automatic
translator and veneer generator from module definition files.

 * Macros changed to functions. Original macro SWILib now only used to make
DefMod (without this, you would have a circular build process with nowhere to
start).

 * Many extra SWI's covered.

 * Wimp_Message structures now divided into two sorts: "system messages", in
the union Wimp_Message, and others which may be provided by other modules
(the WIMP also provides some of these).

 * X and non-X forms provided.

 * OS_F, Font_F instead of OS_Handle, Font_Handle.
