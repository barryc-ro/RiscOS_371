; Sources.CFSI-JPEG
; This makes an image of assembler code that can be loaded in by ChangeFSI
; and then called, to decode a JPEG file.

; At the start of the image are defined entrypoints.
; Conditions for entering these are:
;   lr = return address
;   sp -> a useable stack
;   r0..r3 = arguments (could be more on stack)
; On exit:
;   r0 will contain a returned result, if defined
;   r1..r3, lr will be trashed
;   all other registers will be preserved
