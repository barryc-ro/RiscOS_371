/* ----------------------------- flex_alloc -------------------------------
 * Description:   Allocates n bytes of store, obtained from the Wimp.
 *
 * Parameters:    flex_ptr anchor -- to be used to access allocated store
 *                int n -- number of bytes to be allocated
 * Returns:       0 == failure, 1 == success
 * Other Info:    You should pass the & of a pointer variable as the first
 *                parameter. The allocated store MUST then be accessed
 *                indirectly, through this, ie. (*anchor)[0] ..(*anchor)[n]
 *                This is important since  the allocated store may later be
 *                moved (it's a shifting heap!!). If there's not enough
 *                store returns zero leaving anchor unchanged.

 *                int by -- extent
 * Returns:       0 == failure, 1 == success
 * Other Info:    If by is +ve, then store is extended, and locations above
 *                "at" are copied up by "by".
 *                If by is -ve, then store is reduced, and any bytes beyond

/* ---------------------------- flex_budge --------------------------------
 * Description:    Function to move flex store, when the C library needs
 *                 to extend the heap.
 *
 * Parameters:     int n -- number of bytes needed by C library
 *                 void **a -- address of acquired store.  
 * Returns:        amount of store acquired.
 * Other Info:     Don't call this function directly, but register it 
 *                 with the C library via:
 *                    _kernel_register_slotextend(flex_budge);
 *                 This will cause flex store to be moved up if the C
 *                 library needs to extend the heap.  Note that in this 
 *                 state, you can only rely on pointers into flex blocks 
 *                 across function calls which do not extend the stack and 
 *                 do not call malloc.
 *                 The default state is flex_dont_budge, so, if required, 
 *                 this function should be registered AFTER calling 
 *                 flex_init().

/* -------------------------- flex_dont_budge -----------------------------
 * Description:   Function to refuse to move flex store, when the C library 
 *                needs to extend the heap.
 *
 * Parameters:    int n -- number of bytes needed by C library
 *                void **a -- address of acquired store.
 * Returns:       amount of store acquired (always 0).
 * Other Info:    Don't call this function directly, but register it 
 *                with the C library via:
 *                   _kernel_register_slotextend(flex_dont_budge);
 *                If the C library needs to extend the heap, flex will 
 *                refuse to move. This means that you can rely on pointers 
 *                into flex blocks across function calls.
 *                This is the DEFAULT state after flex_init().

 * Description:   Initialise store allocation module.

 * Returns:       void.
 * Other Info:    Must be called before any other functions in this module.
 *                program_name must point at a character string
 *                whose lifetime is the entire program (eg a string
 *                literal, or static buffer).
 *                error_fd is a pointer to a file descriptor as returned
 *                by MessageTrans_OpenFile - it will be used to report flex
 *                errors.  If it is 0, then English default messages are used.
