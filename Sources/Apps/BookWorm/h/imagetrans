 * At present GIF, JPEG and XBM are handled internally. Anything else will be
 * farmed out to ChangeFSI, but the user interface will remain the same.
 *
 * If you pass a null pointer (not a null string), the library will attempt
 * to determine the type of image itself. Note that LoadFromCache will not
 * work if you do this (yet).
 *
 * You must not attempt to render the image until width is >0.
 * When this occurs the image is ready to be rendered (at least in part).
 *
 * This call may fail due to lack of memory (or an invalid type). In this case
 * it will return a null pointer.

/* MEMBER FUNCTIONS */

/*
 * Load - call when you have received some more of an image
 *
 * data should point to the next len bytes of image data. On exit, width and height
 * will be set if the renderer knows the size of the image yet. If it does, "changed"
 * (if non-NULL) will be filled to mark the area of the image that has changed since
 * the last call to LoadImage. Note that a section of the image may change several
 * times during loading (eg interlaced GIFs). Coordinates start at (0,0) in the
 * bottom left of the image, and are measured in OS units.
  *
 * When you have passed Load all the data, call EndLoad.
 *
 * Many image formats will not actually be able to do any rendering until EndLoad
 * has been called.
 *
 * If an error is returned, or you wish to abort the loading yourself, stop
 * calling Load, and call EndLoad. You shouldn't call Load again once it has
 * returned an error.
 *
 * After calling EndLoad, you can check whether width != -1. If it isn't, the
 * image is usable, and you can keep it. If width is -1, then the image is
 * unusable, and you should Delete it (see below).
 *
 * If the changed box returned is "negative", ie ymax<ymin or xmax<xmin, then
 * you should treat it as marking the area that doesn't need to be redrawn.
 * eg if the image is 100 pixels high (ie 200 OS units), ymax is 50 and ymin
 * is 150, then you should redraw the regions (0<=y<50) and (150<=y<200).
 * This is used in interlaced GIFs, when a new pass is started
 *
 */

/*
 * EndLoad - call this when all the data has been passed to Load successfully,
 * or if you want to abort a load, or if Load has returned an error.
 */

/*
 * Render - plot an image onto the screen
 *
 * This will plot an image with its bottom-left corner at (x,y)
 * scale is a percentage scale (ie 100=normal size)
 *
 * Translation tables, etc, are handled automatically.
 */

/*
 * DumpSprite - obtain a copy of the image as a sprite
 *
 * This call will dump the image, in sprite format, to a file. You should normally
 * only need to obtain a sprite copy of the file when transferring to another
 * application, or saving to disc, so this should be sufficient. maxbpp may
 * be 1,2,4,8,16,32 or -1 for don't care. This may be ignored. However, 16bpp+
 * images will only be produced on RISC OS 3.5+ machines.
 *
 */

/*
 * DumpToCache - dump the image into a "cache" file
 *
 * This call is intended to dump an Image into a cache file. The format of
 * the cache file is undefined. On return (if there is no error) you should
 * check the value of justuseorig. If it is 1, then no cache file has been
 * saved. Rather than doing "LoadFromCache", just refeed the image the
 * original data. This will apply to JPEGs, which are not processed prior
 * to display.
 *
 */

/*
 * LoadFromCache - load an image from a "cache" file
 *
 * This call should be made immediately after NewImage. It will create
 * an image from a file previously saved using "DumpToCache".
 *
 */

/*
 * StartExport - initiate an export of the image, in sprite format
 *
 * Note that the export routines are non-reentrant. Once you have called
 * StartExport, do not call any export routines for any other images
 * until you have called EndExport. size will be updated to the total
 * size for the export.
 *
 */

/*
 * Export - take the next chunk of image
 *
 * This copies the next len bytes of the sprite into the buffer. len is
 * updated to say how many bytes were transferred. If len is zero
 * on return, the export is finished.
 *
 */

/*
 * EndExport - finish the export of an image
 *
 * Call this after taking the last chunk of data, or to abort an export.
 *
 */

/*
 * ModeChange - signal change of mode or palette
 *
 * This should be called for each image whenever the palette or the screen mode
 * changes. It does not need to be done when the sprite is first created
 */

/*
 * BGCol - find the colour of an image
 *
 * Before calling, place the background colour the image is being placed upon
 * into bgcol - this will allow sensible results where the image contains
 * transparent areas.
 * If bgcol contains -2 on exit, then the image library cannot determine
 * the colour of the image - use your best guess (eg don't anti-alias if
 * no BG tag was supplied, or anti-alias to a specific BG tag).
 * If bgcol contains -1 on exit, the image does not have a clear overall
 * background colour (so don't antialias any text placed upon it). Otherwise
 * the result is a standard palette word (0xBBGGRR00) indicating the approximate
 * colour of the image.
 */

/*
 * Delete - delete an Image
 *
 * Call this when you have no further use for an image. All its memory (including
 * the Image structure itself) will be freed.
 */
