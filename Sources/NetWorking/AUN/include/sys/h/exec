 * Revision 1.1  95/01/11  10:19:13  kwelton
 * Initial revision
 * 
 * Revision 1.13  88/10/25  22:29:02  brian
 * Definition of MAXSHLIBS moved to sysconf.h
 * 
 * Revision 1.12  88/10/25  13:21:14  brian
 * New magic numbers for shared libraries.
 * 
 * Revision 1.11  88/09/20  18:34:50  john
 * Changed magic numbers for shared libraries, added as link
 * time stamp.
 * 
 * Revision 1.10  88/09/15  18:34:14  abray
 * Amended version part of exec header, so kernel can use a consistent format
 * (new include file sys/version.h)
 * 
 * Revision 1.9  88/09/13  11:16:15  john
 * Added RMAGIC magic number to deal with references to shared libraries.
 * 
 * Revision 1.8  88/08/25  02:51:26  keith
 * Define exec_header to be the extended header that exists on the front
 * of all types of file the kernel understands. For compatibility leave
 * "struct exec" as it always has been.
 * 
 * Revision 1.7  88/08/24  12:02:46  keith
 * Reverting to the original struct exec; with the additions
 * in a new structure. This is a) to reduce space on disc within
 * things like libraries which dont need the information, and
 * b) because the bootstrapping problems encountered with changing
 * the format were daunting.
 * 
 * Revision 1.6  88/08/19  10:46:45  keith
 * Corret spelling of (as yet unused) SPZMAGIC a_magic type.
 * Re-order fields (no users yet) of a_spare -> a_verstime.
 * 
 * Revision 1.5  88/08/18  15:05:29  keith
 * Include <sys/types.h> to stop things that include this file complaining
 * 
 * Revision 1.4  88/08/11  09:23:57  keith
 * exec struct extended to provide support for QMAGIC squeezed images
 * and (future) shared libraries.
 * A version string can also be inserted in the header.
 * 
 * Revision 1.3  88/06/17  20:19:09  beta
 * Acorn Unix initial beta version
