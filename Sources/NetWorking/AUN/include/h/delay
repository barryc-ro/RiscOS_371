 *
 * The MICRODELAY macro provides a cpu-busy-wait to give a short timing
 * slug for nefarious purposes.  Note that it should have the effect
 * of waiting for AT LEAST the specified period:  depending on the
 * compiler, it may well hang about for a little longer...
 *
 * The effect of the MICRODELAY macro is now just to call the DELAY_ 
 * function (implemented in delay.s) with the desired delay in 
 * microseconds as parameter.  The actual function takes care of
 * speed adjustments according to its operating environment.
