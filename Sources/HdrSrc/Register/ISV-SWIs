;   The Chunk macro takes its first argument, on the line before the MACRO
;   invocation, as part of a symbol to generate (this symbol is made by
;   appending the string "SWI_Base" to the argument.  This value is the base
;   value allocated to the SWI chunk.  This value increments by &40
;   each time and should be used by module source code to assemble the module
;   header with e.g. DCD MyChunkSWI_Base
;
;   The argument after the invocation (second) is the estimated value that the
;   SWI chunk will have, this value is ASSERTed by the MACRO and an assembly
;   will fail if the estimate is wrong.
;
;   The next (third) argument is the name of the vendor or company.  This is
;   used to group SWI chunk symbols together for a single vendor.  The next
;   (fourth) argument is optional and if not present defaults to the
;   value of the first argument, it is used to check that the SWI name prefix
;   allocated is unique.  When assembled with the variable SWI_Name_Clash true
;   extra code is assembled to ensure that every name is indeed unique, an EQU
;   will fail with a "Multiply or incompatibly defined symbol" error if a
;   non-unique name is found.  To prevent this from occuring when it is
;   specifically desired to have the same name prefix for more than one chunk,
;   a fifth optional argument "NameOK" can be added to suppress this check.
;   The values of the names are generated with variable names with "SWI_Name"
;   appended.  See Hdr:SWIs for example output.
;
;   The ChunkM macro should be used to allocate a chunk for wimp messages. 
;   It takes the same first three arguments as the Chunk macro, it doesn't
;   need a forth string argument or a NameOK argument.  The ChunkM macro
;   generates symbols of the form ThingMessage with the chunk number and
;   ThingMessage_Base with the actual value i.e. &0008xxxx.  Note that
;   Chunks allocated for messages should be in the application area.  If an
;   allocation is going to be used both for SWIs and for messages then use
;   the Chunk macro and note the message use in the comment field.
