File format AE7: ARMovie
========================

Start of file:

String          ARMovie
String          Movie name
String          date and copyright details
String          author and other details
String          video compression format identifier     [0 -> no video]
Decimal number  x size in pixels
Decimal number  y size in pixels
Decimal number  z pixel depth in bits [16 or 8]
Decimal number  number of frames per second to project at
String          sound compression format identifier     [0 -> no sound]
Decimal number  sound replay rate in Hz (or fractions of)
Decimal number  number of sound channels recorded ("reversed" if l<->r)
Decimal number  sound precision ("linear" if linear, "unsigned" if unsigned)
Decimal number  number of frames in a chunk
Decimal number  number of chunks NC (chunks start at 0!!!!)
Decimal number  "even" chunk size in bytes
Decimal number  "odd" chunk size in bytes
Decimal number  offset to chunk catalogue CC
Decimal number  offset to "helpful" sprite
Decimal number  size in bytes of the "helpful" sprite info
Decimal number  offset to key frames                    [0/null -> no keys]
                other gunge as required

(all fields are ASCII text terminated by NewLine; spaces
ignored, arbitrary comment text after numeric field permitted)

byte CC: start of catalogue of chunks
         this has NC+1 entries of the form:
              file offset of chunk (maybe multiple of 1024)
              size of video data
              size of sound data (immediately after video data)
         arranged FO,BS;OS<newline> (spaces permitted except in numbers)

The 'key frame offset' points to a set of NC (not NC+1) blocks of data
containing x*y*z bits. These allow the decompressor to start at a particular
chunk. Starting at the first chunk doesn't need a reference to the key frame
offsets.

If the pixel depth is 8, then a palette may be provided by including the text
'palette <decimal number>' which gives the offset of the palette in the file
(the palette is stored as 256 triple bytes, r then g then b). If there is no
palette, then the data is taken as 0-255 greyscale.

If the sound format is 2, the name of the sound decompressor file follows after
a single space: '2 soundxxx'. Playing programs rely on this to find the
decompressor.

Multiple Sound Tracks
---------------------

The single video track can have an arbitrary number of sound tracks associated
with it. Extra sound track data for each sound parameter follows the sound
track marker "|" plus the sound track number. Different sound tracks can have
completely different parameters - compression format, sample rate, number of
channels, number of bits per sample. The first sound track is played by default
and does not follow a |1 marker - thus the first additional sound track has
parameters following a |2 marker.

Example:
ARMovie
The Concert
(c) Notts University 1991
Created by Notts University, digitised by Acorn Computers
1
160 pixels
128 pixels
16 bits per pixel 
25 frames per second
1                               |2   2 CELP1               |3  1
12000 Hz samples                |2   16000                 |3  20000
1 channel                       |2   2 channels            |3  2 channels
8 bits per sample (exponential) |2   16 bits per sample    |3  4 bits (adpcm)
50 frames per chunk
57 chunks
236080
228992
10580256 catalogue offset
512 sprite offset
20480 sprite size
105602 key frames offset

The catalogue entries are similarly marked:

              file offset of chunk (maybe multiple of 1024)
              size of video data
              size of sound data 1 (immediately after video data)
              |2
              size of sound data 2 (immediately after sound data 1)
         arranged FO,BS;OS|2 OS<newline> (spaces permitted except in numbers)

Playing sound tracks later than the first one uses more memory (the decompressor
reads the chunk up to and including the sound data it needs).

16 bit sound data is aligned to the next word.

Although it is possible to have multiple sound tracks in a file with no video,
it is probably better to have multiple ARMovie files instead.

A note about the ARMovie's file name
------------------------------------

The movie replay program adds the ARMovie$Suffix to any path name given to it:
it tries to open this file, then tries again with the original path name. (just
like the window manager with !Sprites, !Sprites22 etc). This allows a degree of
personalisation of replay invisible to all programs.
 
Therefore we recommend the follow standard suffix characters:

"2" a movie made at half the frame rate of its base movie
    this movie can be expected to be playable on less powerful machines
    (generalise if required!)

"S" a movie made with much smaller chunks than its base movie
    this movie can be expected to be playable on small memory machines (an "S"
    suffix movie may not work from a CD-ROM drive). For example if the base
    movie has 2 second chunks, then an "S" suffix might only have 1 second
    chunks.

"L" a movie made with much larger chunks than its base movie
    this movie will not work on CD-ROM, but can be copied from CD-ROM to
    a faster filing system (winchester, magneto-optic) and played. Such movies
    will usually require an ARM3 (or better) to replay them.

If two suffixes are available, then the 2 should come first.

Calling programs should use the shortest name possible.

A note about compression numbers
--------------------------------

The compression values allow for new video (de)compressors to be written in the
future. The Player program inspects the video value and, if it cannot process
the format (using the Decompress codes: see "DecompIf"), calls
<ARMovie$Dir>.DeComp<X>.!RunImage where <X> is the decimal string of the value
of the compression type. Thus new compression types can be added transparently.

Compression types are allocated as follows:

   0-99: Acorn
         video                                     audio
         0: no video                               0: no audio
         1: 'Moving Lines' compression             1: basic audio
         2: 16bpp uncompressed (15 bit data)       2: 'indirect' audio
         3: 10bpp YUV chroma horiz subsampled by 2
         4: 8bpp uncompressed [pixel depth=8]
         5: 8bpp YUV chroma horiz and vert subsampled by 2
         6: 6bpp YUV chroma horiz and vert subsampled by 4
         7: 'Moving Blocks' compression
         [all but type 4 have pixel depth=16]
         8: 24bpp uncompressed
         9: 16bpp YUV chroma horiz subsampled by 2
        10: 12bpp YUV chroma horiz and vert subsampled by 2
        11: 9bpp YUV chroma horiz and vert subsampled by 4
         [all pixel depth=24]

100-199: EIDOS

200-299: Irlam instruments

300-399: Wild Vision

400-499: Aspex Software

Different compression types may have different sound compression (indeed, the
entire meaning of the sound compression field is defined by the video
compression type). However, if the sound compression is the same as one of the
other sound compression methods, then the same number should be used - and,
conversely, if a different sound compression method is being used, then a
different number should be used. (Whew, what a nasty sentence). Thus companies
should either use recognised sound compression numbers (and code...) or they
should restrict their sound compression numbers to the same range as their
video compression numbers.

Providing new sound compression formats should be done in format 2.

Decompress formats
------------------

For any formats which use the Decompress Interface, in particular format 1,
the Acorn Moving Lines compression algorithm, there are some restrictions to
the format:

- the chunks should be consecutive: the !ARMovie.Player tries to load pairs of
  chunks in order to address CD-ROM access latency.

- the chunks are on CD-ROM sector boundaries, padded by zero.

!ARMovie.Player understands audio types 0, 1 and 2. In format 1 there are 10
sound formats:

8 bit linear unsigned mono or stereo
8 bit linear signed mono or stereo
8 bit exponential mono or stereo
16 bit linear signed mono or stereo
4 bit ADPCM (compressed 16 bit linear) mono or stereo

The software decompression of 4bit ADPCM requires output buffers the size of
the supporting machine's sound format - 8 bit ones on current machines. In
format 2 there is an arbitrary number of sound formats.

A note about Stereo sound
-------------------------

For a stereo sample, the left channel is the first sample, the right the
second, etc. If this is not the case, include the word "reversed" in the
number of channels field: "2 channels reversed".

WARNING: for type 1, audio type 1, Stereo 16 bits linear assumes that the
start of each sound chunk is word aligned.
