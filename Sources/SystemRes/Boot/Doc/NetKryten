2. Outstanding Issues
=====================

a) It is possible that the overhead of enumerating the directories PreDesk
   (4 times) and Tasks (twice) is too high, based on similar complaints
   received during development of the Printer Manager. If experiment proves
   that this is so, some simplification may be needed.

b) Should CMOS images be allowed choices directories other than the machine-specific
   ones? If they were, it might well save system managers on homogeneous networks a lot
   of time; but this must be balanced against the possibility of inappropriate CMOS being
   loaded. The assumption here is that CMOS files will only be saved to net on a machine
   specific basis.

c) It is possible that the 'Floppy disc boot' option from ß5.7 is technically infeasible.
   In such a case, it will not be implemented.

d) We have to check our VProtect licence.

e) The product organisation of the network setup application suite - ie. what software
   goes on what floppies - is not specified here, and will be clarified by the associated
   specification 'Black ROM and Disc Structures Functional Specification', 1303,006/FS.

f) How do we allow the 'memfix' bug fix utility to be loaded from net on RISC OS 3.50
   machines - and is this even possible, given the initialisation of network software
   before using memfix?

g) Should networking ISVs such as SJ identify show-stopping issues requiring changes to
   this system these may need to be made.


3. Product Overview 
===================

All Kryten (and Stork) models will be supplied with a hard disc or as network stations -
the design can assume mass storage available. 'Network only' Krytens will not be intended
for use disconnected from a network - in such a situation, the only performance
assured here from such a machine is to start up with a visible screen able to show error
messages (eg. to indicate what the net fault is). 'Network only' Krytens may manage
considerably better than this without network connection, but that is yet to be determined
and not specified here.

This document specifies the changes to be made to RISC OS 3.5 and its accompanying disc
image to support the (hard-discless) network only Kryten. These changes consist of new
network booting applications, entitled ArmBoot and ShareBoot supplied on disc, plus some
extensions to the OS ROM. 'Network only' Krytens will be supplied with a set of 10 1.6MB
floppy discs containing the 'Network Setup Application Suite'. (The figure 10 is
derived from the 'Black ROM and Disc Structures Functional Specification - 1303,006/FS.)
This disc set will be used by a priviledged system user to set up fileservers from which to
boot network only Krytens. For more details of its contents, see the associated
specification 'Black ROM and Disc Structures Functional Specification', 1303,006/FS.


4. Concepts And Definitions
===========================

4.1 Problems To Solve
---------------------

RISC OS 3.5, the starting point for the RISC OS Black development, was designed on the
assumption of the presence of a hard disc in each machine. Replacing this hard disc
with a network, for the 'network only' Kryten introduces the following problems to
solve:

a) Network storage areas user specific, not machine specific - a user may log on on
   different machines, with the same URD ... not possible with an ADFS hard disc alone.

b) Network connections may fail, so the machine has to be more self-sufficient without
   mass storage.

c) Security is more important on networks than hard discs.

d) Networks may contain mixtures of machines with various releases of RISC OS.

e) Applications may not be placed in standard places - a greater flexibility is
   required in locating applications to be displayed in the icon bar 'Apps' viewer.

f) Networks have lower and variable data transfer rates compared with hard discs.

g) More than one type of network must be supported - see 4.2 below.

h) Network fileservers are usually set up on site by IT coordinators, not pre-set
   on manufacture - introducing more user complexity and room for error.


4.2 Design Principles
---------------------

The problems to solve listed above lead to a combination of technical solutions and design
principles:

- Complexity is kept to an absolute minimum (for ease of use for client and
  IT Coordinator).

- User familiarity is retained as much as possible - user interface differences
  from RISC PC (RISC OS 3.5 Boot) and hard disc Krytens minimised.

- No files need to be stored on each client machine (eg. on floppy) - all
  files are loaded, etc. from the network.

- Configuration is split between machine-specific details stored in central
  system privilege, world read only fileserver areas indexed by machine-specific
  address, and user-specific details stored in users' URD's.

- The RISC OS Black ArmBoot application remains compatible with all versions
  of RISC OS from 2.0 onwards, merely running with version-dependent features
  disabled as appropriate.

- The mechanism must work on Acorn Access and Level 4 networks (including Econet only,
  Ethernet only, and mixed AUN nets). No mechanism exists for NFS, and so is not specified
  here.

- It is borne in mind that support will be needed for RISC PC's, both
  with and without local media support.


4.3 Boot-up Sequence
--------------------

On a Level 4 network:

1) The client machine is configured to FileSystem Net, Boot, so when it is powered
   up or reset with CTRL/BREAK or CTRL/RESET, it initialises its ROM modules (system
   ROM plus network card ROM) and logs on as user 'Boot' to the network.

2) The client machine then runs the ArmBoot APPLICATION that is stored in the
   read only Boot account (ususally the fileserver exported root directory).

3) The ArmBoot application may overwrite the client CMOS configuration memory with
   a CMOS image stored within the ArmBoot application on the net with a file/path
   name indexed by the client machine address, as discussed in ß5.5.

4) The ArmBoot application contains read-only resources such as System, Fonts
   etc. These are booted.

5) The ArmBoot application executes a *Net:Bye to log the client off (as 'Boot').

6) The client machine is now ready for use by an end user. This user now logs
   onto the net using their own ID and password, displaying their URD.

7) An ArmBoot FILE is run automatically from the URD. This is of type Desktop.

8) The ArmBoot file filer_boot's: read/write resources such as Scrap; non-ROM
   applications placed in central read-only directories.

9) The ArmBoot file runs chosen applications etc. as a Desktop save file normally
   does.

10) The client machine is now fully available for work, being set up with both
    machine specific and user specific configuration.

On an Acorn Access network:

1) The client machine is configured to FileSystem Share, Boot, so that when it is
   powered up or reset with CTRL/BREAK or CTRL/RESET, it initialises its ROM
   modules and mounts the configured directory over the net.

2) The client machine then runs the ShareBoot APPLICATION that it finds in the
   mounted directory.

3) The ShareBoot application may overwrite the client CMOS configuration memory with
   a CMOS image stored within the ShareBoot application on the net with a file/path
   name indexed by the client machine address (as discussed in ß5.5), with read only
   access permission.

4) The ShareBoot application contains read-only resources such as System, Fonts
   etc., plus the read/write resource Scrap. These are booted.

5) The client machine is now ready for use by an end user. This user now menus on
   the mounted disc icon on the icon bar, chooses 'Show discs' to display then
   mount other discs containing their working files.

6) If the user wishes, he/she double clicks on a Desktop save file they have
   stored earlier, eg. with a filename based on their own name.

7) The Desktop save file filer_boot's non-ROM applications placed in central
   read-only directories.

8) The Desktop save file runs chosen applications etc.

9) The client machine is now fully available for work, being set up with both
   machine specific and user specific configuration.


4.4 Objects New Or Changed
--------------------------

a) A new application 'ArmBoot' will be created for Level4 booting. This will be created
   by modifying the Boot application supplied with RISC OS 3.5, which will be supplied
   largely unaltered with hard disc Kryten and Stork systems.

b) A new application 'ShareBoot' will be created for Acorn Access booting. This is the
   sister application of the almost identical 'ArmBoot' application referred to above, and
   will also be created by modifying the Boot application.

c) A new application called 'MchConfig' will be created to assist IT coordinators saving 
   configuration within ArmBoot or ShareBoot ready for loading at end user
   boot time.

d) A new relocatable module 'BootCommands' will be created to implement some of the
   command line utilities such as *AddApp contained in !Boot.Library in RISC OS 3.5. This
   will guarantee the availability of these commands without requiring repeated reloading
   from the file server.

f) The Boot application will be modified (leaving the user interface unchanged) to
   take advantage of changes to ROM contents, eg. no need for some command line
   utilities as a result of d) above.

g) A cut-down version of Boot for emergency use (floppy disc boot) when net boot
   has failed. This will contain Scrap, but have several other resources removed
   to leave at least 1MB free on a 1.6MB floppy disc for Scrap to expand into.

h) A new version of Configure is needed. See ß5.9 below to see more details.

i) The Desktop module will be modified to check for successful system boot when the desktop
   is started. If the configured boot-app could not be run, for any reason, then a message
   will be displayed saying that the boot has failed, giving the reason for failure and
   providing the options 'Retry', 'Cancel' and 'Boot from floppy.' The latter will simply
   execute the command '/ADFS::0.!Boot'; it will not honour the Opt 4 setting of the disc.


4.5 Interaction With Lock
-------------------------

The Lock configuration facility, as implemented for RISC OS 3.5, can lock CMOS from user
alteration either in software alone, or as controlled by a hardware link. If CMOS is locked,
ArmBoot and ShareBoot will not attempt to over-write CMOS during network boot. Thus the IT
coordinator has a choice of two ways of protecting CMOS of network booted machines from user
tampering - either overloading with definitive CMOS images from the network at boot time, or
locking CMOS. Both cannot be used together.

The decision as to which of these (if any) is appropriate will probably call for
some discussion in the manual, as it is a difficult one since the CMOS contains a
mixture of local (machine-specific) and global (network-specific) state, together
with user preferences.


4.6 Multiple Boot Applications
------------------------------

Users of machines with hard discs may execute the !Boot application on their hard disc
when they power up, then use a network and encounter !ArmBoot or !ShareBoot applications.
Any attempt to execute such a second boot application will have no effect.

If two of the boot applications, eg. ArmBoot and ShareBoot, are placed next to each other
in the same directory - eg. the root exported directory of a fileserver - then a client
machine may 'see' both applications at the same time. Depending on the filing system,
one will be run, the other just booted. Use of environment variables will ensure that
the booting of the second boot application will have no effect.


5. User Interface
=================

5.1 UI Road Map
---------------

5.1.1 End-User Boot-Up 
----------------------

The end-user boot-up sequence of events and actions is as described in ß4.3 above.


5.1.2 Level4 Fileserver Setup
-----------------------------

This is done by the IT coordinator, either using the fileserver disc directly from ADFS on
the host machine, or logging on as system user. He/she:

- Ensures an appropriate area of the disc is exported over the network as a Level4
  fileserver.

- Copies ArmBoot from the Network Setup Application Suite discs to the root of the exported
  area, removing Configure from inside ArmBoot to a safe place if he/she so wishes.

- Places a copy of Scrap in each user's URD as is usual for Level4.

- Copies the rest of the Network Setup Application Suite to a subdirectory 'Apps' of the
  exported root directory so that ArmBoot ensures they are automatically displayed in
  the Apps icon viewer.


5.1.3 Acorn Access Host Setup
-----------------------------

This is done by the IT coordinator, using the exported disc directly from ADFS on the host
machine. He/she:

- Exports an appropriate area of the disc as a shared network resource.

- Copies ShareBoot from the Network Setup Application Suite discs to the exported area,
  removing Configure from inside ShareBoot to a safe place if he/she so wishes.

- Ensures that all of ShareBoot is exported read-only except for Scrap inside it
  which is exported read/write.

- Copies the rest of the Network Setup Application Suite to a directory 'Apps' placed next
  to ShareBoot, making sure this area is exported read-only.


5.1.4 Client Machine Setup
--------------------------

This is done by the IT coordinator, working from the client machine in question. He/she:

- Gains write access to ArmBoot/ShareBoot by logging on as system user (Level4) or adjusting
  access details temporarily to export read/write using the host machine while no users
  are around (Acorn Access).

- Uses MchConfig to set up a machine-specific directory within ArmBoot/ShareBoot.

- On the client machine runs Configure and uses the command line to set the client CMOS
  as required (eg. FileSystem Share, Boot).

- Uses MchConfig to save either the machine's CMOS, or the machine's configuration files,
  or both, to a definitive copy stored within ArmBoot or ShareBoot within a directory
  named after the unique address of the client machine (ie. specific to the client
  machine).

- If using Acorn Access returns to the host machine and returns the access permission
  for ShareBoot to read-only export, except for Scrap (read/write).


5.1.5 End-User Option Save
--------------------------

This is done by the end user working from a client machine, to save preferences such as
which applications get auto-run on boot. He/she:

- Sets the machine up as they want it to boot up.

- Opens a directory viewer for their URD (Level4) or a disc area they can write to on
  Acorn Access.

- Saves the Desktop save file from the TaskManager 'nut' to this viewer. If using Level4
  they use the filename '!ArmBoot'. If using Acorn Access, they use any name they wish,
  eg. a name derived from their personal name.


5.2 Boot (standard version) 
---------------------------

The user interface of the Boot application will not be materially altered by RISC OS
Black. The functionality of Boot will be altered in detail by removing some components as
their features are added elsewhere. The utilities in !Boot.Library implementing command
line keywords will be superseded by the BootCommands module (see 5.6) under Black (but the
library versions must still exist in ArmBoot and ShareBoot for older operating systems).
If a part of ARMovie is placed in ROM, it will of course not be duplicated in Boot. See
the associated 'Black ROM and Disc Structures Functional Specification', 1303,006/FS, for
more details of what is to be moved from Boot to ROM.


5.3 ArmBoot and ShareBoot  
-------------------------

The ArmBoot and ShareBoot applications are almost identical. Their differences are: name (as
required for Level4 and Acorn Access respectively); ArmBoot logs the user ('Boot') off at
the end of its boot sequence; and ShareBoot contains Scrap and ArmBoot doesn't. ArmBoot
can't contain Scrap, since the Boot URD it resides in is world read-only. Acorn Access
allows more flexibility on this, so Scrap can be included in ShareBoot.

The sister applications are both closely related to Boot. Their user interface, structure
and contents are basically the same, their functionality differing from Boot in the
following respects:

a) ArmBoot and ShareBoot will both 'work' - go through a boot sequence without
   failing with compatibility errors - on clients running all versions of RISC OS
   from version 2.00 onwards. Operating system version dependent features will be
   automatically disabled rather than attempted producing errors on early RISC OS
   versions. The RO200Hook and RO310Hook obey files will be replaced with
   directories of the same names containing !Run files and RISC OS 2 and 3.10
   resources so that instead of producing errors, they obey the !Run files and
   load resources as required by the earlier RISC OS versions. Note that System
   contains directories for modules specific to versions of RISC OS, so System
   and its contents do not need to be placed in these 'Hook' directories. Example
   resources that do are RISC OS 2 Fonts within RO200Hook, and NewLook within
   RO310Hook.

b) ArmBoot and ShareBoot both contain machine configuration subdirectories into which the
   MchConfig application can be used to save CMOS files.

c) When a client machine boots with ArmBoot or ShareBoot, if a CMOS file is
   stored within a subdirectory with a name mapping to the client's machine
   address then that CMOS image will be automatically loaded into the client's
   CMOS - overriding any temporary configuration set up by users. If CMOS is
   locked on the client machine, either by software or by the hardware link,
   CMOS is not loaded.

d) At the end of its boot sequence, ArmBoot logs the user off the fileserver as
   pseudo-user 'Boot' so they can log on next to their own account.

e) ArmBoot and ShareBoot both contain a directory Library with utility programmes. Boot
   applications under Black do not need this because these commands are present in ROM.


5.4 Boot (cut-down application) 
-------------------------------

This is the standard Boot application cut down for floppy disc use by the removal of ARMovie
(application and data), Configure (the application) and Fonts. Double clicking on this
version of Boot displays the error 'You cannot reconfigure this machine'.


5.5 MchConfig  
-------------

   A new application MchConfig will be written to allow a system manager to configure
individual stations separately. This will be based on SaveCMOS. It differs from SaveCMOS in
that it does not have a Restore button/action.

   When you double click on MchConfig, it will offer a dialogue box

      +------------------------------------------------------+
      |                                                      |
      |   Save machine configuration to file server          |
      |                                                      |
      |   Configuration memory                               |
      |   +----------------------------------------------+   |
      |   |                   Unlocked                   |   |
      |   +----------------------------------------------+   |
      |                                                      |
      |   +---+                                              |
      |   | Ä |  Save configuration memory                   |
      |   +---+                                              |
      |   +---+                                              |
      |   |   |  Save configuration files                    |
      |   +---+                                              |
      |                    +----------+    ùù==========ùù    |
      |                    |  Cancel  |    ||   Save   ||    |
      |                    +----------+    ùù==========ùù    |
      +------------------------------------------------------+

   The option buttons are initialised to 'Save configuration memory' only, as indicated
above. The read-only text field below 'Configuration memory' is used to indicate the
current settings of the CMOS lock and the keyboard link. It contains the text 'Unlocked'
(as in the example above), 'Hardware locked', 'Software locked' or 'Hardware and software
locked'. If in any state other than 'Unlocked', the only option available is 'Save
configuration files': the others are shaded.

   Choosing 'Save' will display a SaveAs dialogue initialised to the machine-specific
directory associated with the machine being used (unlike SaveCMOS, which silently saves the
CMOS file within itself on disc); and choosing 'OK' on will save the chosen
aspects of machine configuration in it (creating it if it doesn't already exist). To do
this, it:

a) Determines which Filesystem has been configured.

b) Uses the unique machine address to calculate a directory name which is guaranteed to be
   unique for this computer, using the algorithm that Scrap uses. This name will be denoted
   <machine>.

c) Initialises the SaveAs filename field to '!<boot-app>.MchConfig.<machine>' so most IT
   coordinators using MchConfig are aware where the files are being saved to, but merely
   need to click on OK to perform the save. The SaveAs box icon is a directory icon, to
   indicate that a directory will be created. If dragged, it must be dragged to a Filer
   viewer.

d) If saving configuration memory, saves the CMOS of the machine into !RO<version>CMOS, and
   if saving configuration files, copies the entire contents of <Choices$Dir> into the new
   directory.

s) When new copies are made of the configuration files, the Choices$* variables
   will be updated to refer to the new locations.

   To reverse the effect of MchConfig, the system administrator must delete the unwanted
 files from inside the machine-specific directory.


5.6 BootCommands relocatable module
-----------------------------------

   This implements the following *commands:

   *AddApp <Application name>
   *AppSize <Memory size in Kb>K
   *Do <Command>
   *IfThere <Filename> Then <Command>
   *Repeat <Command> <Directory> [-Directories] [-Applications] [-Files | -Type <file type>]
           [-CommandTail <cmdtail>] [-Tasks]
   *SafeLogon [[:]<station number>|:<File server name>] <user name> [[:<CR>]<Password>]
   *LoadCMOS <file name>

These *commands are the ones implemented by library utilities in !Boot.Library on 
RISC†OS 3.5, together with 2 new ones - SafeLogon and LoadCMOS.

   SafeLogon is a command that executes Logon in an idempotent fashion: i e, it checks first
to see if the user is already logged on to the given file server, and if so, does nothing.
(If NFS is the current filing system, it does not interfere in this way: this is
NetFS-specific.) This change allows Desktop files saved from the Switcher icon to work when
saved as a user's personal startup file (either as &.!ArmBoot in their own URD or using some
local ShareFS convention).

   Note that the boot applications will alias "logon" to "safelogon" and leave this alias
set, so that it is still set when a user comes to log on and uses a desktop save file.
This will be noticeable to users who use a repeated *logon command to effectively do a
*bye then *logon - they will have to do the *bye as well as the second *logon.

   LoadCMOS is a command that takes a CMOS-image file, and loads it into the CMOS of the
computer. All of the CMOS is overwritten, apart from:

      the station number
      the current year
      the DST flag

since these are either not expected to be configured incorrectly, or else are expected to
change in normal use. After the new CMOS has been loaded, the CMOS checksum will be
recalculated.

   None of these commands will have any dependency on disc resources such as Scrap.


5.7 Desktop  
-----------

   When the Desktop starts up it will check the existence of the system variable Boot$Error.
If found, it will display a dialogue box. The overall layout of the dialogue box is:

           -------------------------------------------------------------
           |                                                           |
           |     Machine startup has not completed successfully:       |
           |                                                           |

           |                                                           |

           |                                                           | 
           -------------------------------------------------------------

Retry is the default action button. The error message reported is of course just an example,
assuming that Boot$Error has been found to be "Fileserver 'Wonky' not found".

'Retry' has the effect of performing a shutdown and hard reset.

Since this dialogue behaviour will only be implemented by the RISC OS Black version
of the Kernel and Desktop modules, it will not appear on machines with earlier RISC OS
versions booting from ArmBoot or ShareBoot. Such earlier machines will (as they do at
the moment) display error messages at a command line, then lose them and enter the
desktop if the configured language is the desktop (default).


5.8 Kernel
----------

The kernel will be modified so that if it fails to locate the <boot-app> determined by the
CMOS settings (the configured file system, file server, etc), it will save the error
message responsible for the failure in a system variable Boot$Error.


5.9 Configure 
--------------

Configure will be supplied within Boot, ArmBoot and ShareBoot in the same way that it is
within RISC OS 3.5 Boot (though with the expectation that IT coordinators may well choose to
remove it elsewhere). The version used will be derived from the Orlando project,
incorporating bug fixes made since RISC OS 3.5.

It will be modified in the following respects:

a) Instead of always editing files in Boot, as it does under RISC OS 3.5, it will understand
   that ArmBoot or ShareBoot may instead be the boot application. It determines which of
   these to edit by looking at the setting of the configured filesystem: ArmBoot for Net,
   ShareBoot for Share, Boot for anything else. (If the user wants to edit more than one of
   these, he/she must use the *command to change the configuration. Configure remembers
   which is the case at startup: it will not be confused if it changes while it is running.)

b) In the case of a network boot-app, it will always use the files found in <Choices$Dir>.
   In the sequel, these files are referred to as the "configuration files." In other words,
   the configuration files are one of:

         !<boot-app>.MchConfig.<machine>.Boot.PreDesk.Configure and
          !<boot-app>.MchConfig.<machine>.Boot.Tasks.Configure

               where <boot-app> is one of ArmBoot, ShareBoot; or

         !<boot-app>.MchConfig.RO<>Hook.Boot.PreDesk.Configure and
         !<boot-app>.MchConfig.RO<>Hook.Boot.Tasks.Configure

               where <boot-app> is one of ArmBoot, ShareBoot; or

         !<boot-app>.Choices.Boot.PreDesk.Configure and
         !<boot-app>.Choices.Boot.Tasks.Configure

               where <boot-app> is one of Boot, ArmBoot, ShareBoot,


and in any case may be referred to as <Choices$Dir>.PreDesk.Configure and
<Choices$Dir>.Tasks.Configure.
         
c) Its System merging feature is updated to allow merging of the more complex System
   applications as defined in ß6.10.

d) If the configured file system is Net or Share, Configure users (ie. the IT coordinators)
   are warned every time they change global state, ie. change options which
   will result in changes to files within ArmBoot/ShareBoot which are
   common to all users - change either of the last two pairs of files above.

f) In order to edit the global configuration files, it is necessary to use a machine with no
   local ones. If there is no such machine, editing the global ones is pointless anyway, so
   this is not a problem.


5.10 System
-----------

   There is no user-interface change to this application. A new version of SysMerge will be
produced to allow harmonious updating of existing and new Systems.


6. Programmer Interface    
=======================

6.1 Overview
------------

   There is no requirement for programming skills on the part of the IT coordinator. The
following information should not be needed by any user of the system, but may be useful to
those writing applications with special requirements.


6.2 Boot
--------

   The programme interface to a Black Boot application remains as specified in the RISC OS
3.5 PRM supplement.


6.3 ArmBoot and ShareBoot 
-------------------------

   The programme interface to a Black ArmBoot or ShareBoot application is broadly as
specified in the RISC OS 3.5 PRM supplement. However, a programme is not expected to modify
these files, since they are typically shared over a network and will not be writable.

   ArmBoot and ShareBoot will be based on the RISC OS 3.5 Boot application with changes as
developed in the prototype versions of ArmBoot and ShareBoot produced by Carl Sellers and
David Walker for the Training Centre network.

   Where RISC OS versions are used for directory names, etc., they are derived from the
version of the UtilityModule on the machine in question.

   This implies the following structure:

      !<boot-app>.!Boot
                  !Help
                  !Run
                  !Sprites
                  !Sprites22
                  Choices.Boot.Desktop

                                       (etc)
                               PreDesktop
                               Tasks.Configure
                                     (etc)

   The !Run file is executed by the kernel as the machine starts up, and it performs the
following sequence:

      IF    there is a saved CMOS file !<boot-app>.<machine>.!RO<version>CMOS
      THEN  load it
      FI

      IF    there is a machine-specific directory !<boot-app>.<machine>.Boot for this 
               machine
      THEN  Set Choices$Dir to !<boot-app>.<machine>
      ELSE  IF    there is an operating system-specific directory 
                     !<boot-app>.RO<version>Hook.Boot for this machine
            THEN  Set Choices$Dir to !<boot-app>.RO<version>Hook
            ELSE  Set Choices$Dir to !<boot-app>.Choices
            FI
      FI

      Set an alias so Net:Logon translates to SafeLogon
      IF    <version> >= 3.50
      THEN  Set an alias so Desktop_SetPalette translates to '|' - so that such lines
               in desktop save files silently have no effect.
      FI

      FOR   each file in Resources
      DO    Filer_Boot it
      OD

      FOR   each application in <boot-app>$Dir.^.Apps
      DO    AddApp it
      OD

      /<Choices$Dir>.PreDesktop
      FOR   each file in <Choices$Dir>.PreDesk
      DO    take the action according to its type
      OD

      /<Choices$Dir>.Desktop
      FOR   each file in <Choices$Dir>.Tasks
      DO    take the action according to its type
      OD


   Some points to note:

         - The above code is operating system version-independent. If we create a version
      4.00 of RISC OS, an RO400Hook boot, if present, would be performed by such a machine;
      if one were not present, the standard boot would happen anyway. This maintains forward
      and backward compatibility.

         - The variables Choices$* are always set to the values documented in the RISC OS
      3.5 PRM supplement. This will always be useful for applications which wish to read
      options settings, and may be useful to allow a system manager to set up commonly used
      preferences in a network environment.

      - The contents of the directories PreDesk and Tasks are at the
      discretion of the system manager. The diagram above shows the contents of a RISC OS
      3.5 Boot application in the RO350Hook directory, as would normally be the case. Where
      possible, fixed versions of these will be used. In particular, RomPatch is
      3.5-specific: if there is a requirement for patching of the Black ROM, this would
      be a done by a RomPatch in the main Choices directory, also as shown above.

         - The contents of RO{200,310,350}Hook are designed to allow working
      under older versions of the operating system. Under RISC OS 3.5, they
      are obey files, run from <boot-app>.!Run rather than
      <boot-app>.Utils.BootRun and <boot-app>.Utils.DeskRun. In the
      prototype referred to above they are replaced by directories which themselves conform
      to the specification of a 3.5-style Choices directory. This allows consistent
      configuration across all platform types.

         - Although Black will be providing IfThere, Repeat, AddApp etc as
      ROM-based *commands, they must also be present in the library in order
      to support RISC O S 2, 3.1 and 3.5 machines.

         - The PreDesk sequence will define Alias$Logon to be SafeLogon. SafeLogon will
      be provided in !<boot-app>.Library, and also in the BootCommands module, q v.

         - The CMOS images are held inside the <machine> directory for a given machine.
      The name given to the file is derived from the version of the operating system
      under which it was created, as follows:

            RO200       !RO200CMOS
            RO201       !RO201CMOS
            RO300       !RO300CMOS
            RO310       !RO310CMOS
            RO311       !RO311CMOS
            RO350       !RO350CMOS
            Black       !RO360CMOS

      When a machine starts up, it will only look for a file that matches its own version
      number. In this way, if a machine is upgraded but retains its station number, it
      will not load incompatible CMOS.

      The file names all start with '!' in order to avoid conflict with the
      recommendation that applications save their own configuration data in directories
      that do not start with '!'.

         - The BandLimit commands are platform-specific, rather than OS-specific. If
      the default value from the OS-specific directory is not suitable for a certain
      machine, that machine will have to be equipped with its own configuration files
      using MchConfig, and its BandLimt file (which is an obey file containing a
      *VIDCBandwidthLimit command) edited "by hand."     


6.4 Boot (cut-down application) 
-------------------------------

   The programme interface to a Black Boot application remains as specified in the RISC OS
3.5 PRM supplement. The contents are reduced in a way consistent with the original design,
leaving the following.

      !Boot.!Boot
            !Help
            !Run
            !Sprites
            !Sprites22
            Choices.Boot.Desktop
                         PreDesk.Configure
                         PreDesktop
                         Tasks.!ROMPatch (if necessary)
                               Configure
            Library.FontMerge
            Resources.!Scrap
                      !System
                      Configure.2DTools
                                ClrMonitor
                                FontChange
                                Monitors.Acorn.AKF50
                                Textures.T1
            Utils.BandLimit
                  BootRun
                  DeskRun
                  HOff
                  HOn
                  VProtect


6.5 MchConfig  
--------------

   MchConfig will be coded as specified above. The address used will be
derived using the same algorithm as Scrap, which guarantees consistency on all Acorn
networks.


6.6 BootCommands relocatable module 
-----------------------------------

   The BootCommands module will be based on the code existing in the RISC OS 3.5 library
applications, although one of them will have to be converted from BASIC. ROM space
considerations will probably imply an assembler implementation.


6.7 Desktop
-----------

   If there is an error in the boot sequence, <Boot$Error> will have been set to the text of
the message. The Desktop module will be altered to check this variable, report the error if
there is one, and offer the dialogue box pictured above. (This the user to see the when no
boot-app is found.)


6.8 Kernel
----------

   There is no new programmer interface to the kernel.


6.9 Configure 
-------------- 

   This will merge !System applications to form output !System applications as described
below in section 6.10. Modules from a RISC OS 2 !System.Modules will be placed in
!System.Modules, from a RISC OS 3.1 !System.Modules in !System.310.Modules, etc. A check
will then be performed on the version numbers of uncompressed relocatable modules placed in
these directories to ensure that more recent versions of identical modules are not placed
in earlier OS version directories - which would result in the more up to date module only
being loaded on older machines - an error hard for the user to disentangle.


6.10 System
-----------

   A new System, which allows multiple operating system version to share resources, will be
adopted. This is also based on the Carl Sellers/David Walker prototype, with an extension to
provide consistency with ArmBoot applications. It will have a directory structure

      !System.!Boot
              !Help
              !Run
              !Sprites
              !Sprites22
              !Sprites23
              Modules.(modules as required)
                      ...
              310.Modules.(modules as required)
                          ...
              350.Modules.(modules as required)
                          ...
              360.Modules.(modules as required)
                          ...
              SetOSVer
              SetPath

   The top level (!System.Modules) is for modules that will run under 2.00 (and therefore
normally all subsequent versions), !System.310.Modules is for those that require RISC OS
310, etc. (The reason for this is to ensure backwards compatibility with Systems written for
2.00 machines.)

After running !System, the following variables will be set up (where each component on the
right hand side is prefixed by the value of Obey$Dir):

      System$Dir        !System

      System$Path       !System. 
                           (under RISC OS 2.00, 2.01, 3.00)
                        !System.310.,!System. 
                           (under RISC OS 3.10, 3.11)
                        !System.350.,!System.310.,!System. 
                           (under RISC OS 3.50)
                        !System.360.,!System.350.,!System.310.,!System. 
                           (under Black)

In addition, when System is seen by the Filer, these variables will be set up if they are
not already set. Measures will be taken to ensure that System$Path does not exceed the 256
character limit - eg. defining an additional $Path variable, and defining System$Path in
terms of that.

   System$Dir is the same under all versions of RISC OS, since some older applications refer to
<System$Dir>.Modules rather then System:Modules.

   This allows complete flexibility for providing extension modules that will work under any
previous operating systems.
                        

7. Standards 
============

   All enhancements to system software will be made by extended existing
components in a way consistent with their current state, and in accordance with the Style
Guide.


8. Data Interchange 
===================

   No data interchange protocols are specified here.


9. Data Formats 
===============

   No data formats are specified here.

10. External Dependencies 
=========================

   All of the application work and most of the module work can proceed using
existing hardware platforms.


11. Acceptance Tests
====================

11.2 Boot (standard version)  
----------------------------

   This should implement all of the user interface documented in the RISC O S 3.5 PRM
supplement, and be comparable in size.


11.3 ArmBoot and ShareBoot  
---------------------------

   These should implement all of the user interface documented in the RISC O S 3.5 PRM
supplement for Boot, and in a default configuration be of comparable size to a standard Boot
application.

   The time taken to boot a network-only Kryten on a network with 3 others also booting
should not be in excess of 2 minutes.

   It must be possible to put a standard Territory application in a root directory to load
territory-specific files for localisation.


11.4 Boot (cut-down application)  
--------------------------------

   This should implement all of the user interface documented in the RISC O S 3.5 PRM
supplement, and should use 600K or less of disc space.


11.5 MchConfig   
-------------

   This should implement all of the features described above.


11.6 BootCommands relocatable module   
-------------------------------

   This should implement all of the features described above. The code sizes of each of
the new commands referred to above must not exceed more than twofold the size of the file
that currently implements them:

      AddApp      908 bytes
      AppSize     232 bytes
      Do           98 bytes
      IfThere     140 bytes
      Repeat        4Kbytes

The new commands (SafeLogon, LoadCMOS) must not exceed 2K in size each.


11.7 Desktop  
-----------
   This should implement all of the features described above and not grow in size by more
than 5K.


11.8 Kernel 
----------
   This should implement all of the features described above and not grow in size by more
than 1K.


11.9 Configure  
--------------
   This should implement all of the features described above and not grow in size by more
than 5K.


12. Development Test Strategy 
=============================

12.1 Boot
---------

   The provision of a directory for configuration settings in a networked environment will
be tested by doing 'Save choices' from Printers, in each of the following environments:

      a vanilla network-only Kryten
      a network-only Kryten with its own MchConfig directory
      any other version of RISC OS (e g, RISC OS 3.1)

   Also, a test will be made that the Scrap directory is available in each of these cases,
by dragging a text file from Edit onto the Printers icon.


12.2 MchConfig
--------------

   MchConfig will be coverage-tested, in order to ensure that each line of code is
exercised.

   This will involve running on machines with file system configured to Net, Share, and
another filing system; and with/without the CMOS protection link and FSLock protection
enabled.

   It will also be the case that a 'Save choices' operation from the Printer Manager
continues to work (saving the configuration to a different place) after a MchConfig save
of configuration files.


12.3 BootCommands
-----------------

   A machine will be started with

         - a saved Desktop Boot file containing a Logon command to its own Boot file
           server, and

         - saved CMOS.

This will exercise all the facilities of the BootCommands module.


12.4 Desktop
------------

   This will be tested by configuration the file server to an unknown name and rebooting:
the error 'File server 'Unknown' not known' must be presented to the user.


12.5 Kernel
-----------

   The test in 12.4 will also be sufficient to test the new kernel feature.


12.6 Configure
--------------

   Starting with a local disc, the Wimp Font will be changed to Trinity.Medium, then the
configured file system changed to Net, then the font changed back. At each stage, the
contents of !Boot.Choices.PreDesk.Configure will be checked. Then Configure will be
started again, and the same changes made (this time changing the configured file system
back to ADFS): this time, it must be Net::FS.&.!ArmBoot.Choices.PreDesk.Configure that is
edited.

   A System containing all the optional components described above will be merged into the
Boot System, and the results checked. Standard RISC O S 2 and 3 Systems will also be
merged.

   The standard Fonts directory will be merged with the empty Fonts in a cut-down Boot,
and the result checked.


13. Future Enhancements 
======================

   Some future enhancements not to be done as part of the Black project are:

   - Support for booting from NFS

   - Support for booting from third party network systems such as Nexus.

   - Support for combined hard disc and network booting, so the hard disc initialises
     boot and local facilities, the network boot network facilities.

   - Provision of a facility in System so that 2 Systems can be "active" at once: one
     local one, normally searched first, and one network one to act as a central
     repository.

   - Integration of ArmBoot, ShareBoot, hard disc Boots and floppy (cut-down) Boots
     into a single application.

   - Support for more than 77 machines to be booted by one copy of ShareBoot, and
     more than 254 machines by one copy of ArmBoot. (These limits result from the
     maximum number of subdirectories within a directory within ShareFS and Level4
     respectively).
