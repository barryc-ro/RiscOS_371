/*
 * There are several different types of panes. Briefly :-
 *      a) Panes that hang around outside the work area (ie Draw tools pane).
 *      b) Panes that are internal to the window, scroll when it scrolls and are 
 *              covered if the parent shrinks.
 *      c) Panes that attach to the screen pos but can be cut off if the work area 
 *              shrinks (old draw panes vertically).

 * These can be summarised as.
 *      For each direction panes can be.
 *              Attached to logical work area or attached to physical screem area.
 *              Attached to left or right (top or bottom) of screen area.
 *              limited by parent extent or not.
