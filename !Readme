Building the System
===================

(1) Copy the contents of the SrcFiler tree to a hard disc (250Mb or larger).
    Note: The contents of Sources.Import.Aquarius come from the Aquarius
          Source tree - see !ReadMe in the directory for info.

(2) Double-click on !Env4 (build for 4 Megabyte Morris system).

(3) To build ROM image:
      In directory BuildSys.Morris4:
      - Double-click on !Config
        This ensures that the Makefile is uptodate w.r.t. Components

      To clean the system:
      - Double-click on !MkClean
        This will remove all derived objects in the Source tree with the
        following exceptions:
        (a) OSLib - to clean, open Sources.Lib.OSLib and double-click on
            MkClean
        (b) RISC_OSLib - to clean, open Sources.Lib.RISC_OSLib and
            double-click on MkClean
        (c) Dictionary tokens in Sources.OS_Core.Internat.Messages
            It shouldn't be necessary to rebuild the Dictionary, but
            if required, open Sources.OS_Core.Internat.Messages and
            double-click on MkCleanAll
      - The complete Install tree can be deleted (by hand) if wished
      - The complete Export tree can be deleted (by hand) if wished

      To build the system:
      - Double-click on BuildSys.Morris4.!MkSystem
        (if the Export tree hasn't been removed, the first two build phases
         'export hdrs' and 'export libs' can be commented out first).

        When complete, save the contents of the TaskWindow as a logfile
        for future reference. This file should also be checked for errors
        by loading it into an editor and searching for the string AMU:
        OSLib will produce an error for each library component - these can
        be ignored, but any other errors need to be resolved.

      To split the ROM image into two 2Mb parts, use isplit <filename>

(4) To build HardDisc image:
    The harddisc components will be installed in 'Install' by default.
    This can be altered by setting an appropriate path for DiscInstall$Dir
    in !Env4 and re-executing. If the path isn't specified in terms of
    <Build$Dir>, use a complete disc specification:
    e.g. SCSI::disc_name.$.Install_path

      To clean the system:
      - Double-click on BuildSys.HardDisc.!MkClean

      To build the system:
      - Double-click on BuildSys.HardDisc.!Mk

      To install the harddisc components:
      - Double-click on BuildSys.HardDisc.!MkInstall


Release Builds
==============

Creating ChangeLogs
-------------------
1) Log-on to the Black SrcFiler project
2) Run !Env4
3) In BuildUtils.Releases:
     Follow the instructions in the !Readme file.


Special techniques
==================

Rebuilding a ROM Image
----------------------
Once a ROM image has been built, it is relatively quick and easy to update it.

Least error-prone method
------------------------
1) Check-out updated sources for required Components from the SrcFiler
   or add/remove components from the Components file (and run !Config)
2) In Sources.OS_Core.Internat.Messages, run MkClean
3) In BuildSys.Morris4:
     run !MkRes
     run !MkCpInst (this should rebuild Messages and any updated sources)

Extra quick method
------------------
1) Rebuild any updated component using its local MkRom TaskObey file
2) If it's NOT a C component (see Type in Components file), then
   copy the rebuilt module to the appropriate place in the Install
   tree (see Installation dir in Components file).
3) If any of the Component's Resources have changed, then the Resources
   module must be updated.
   (Note: this will always  be the case for Components whose Messages file
   contains their Version)
   In Sources.OS_Core.Internat.Messages, run MkClean 
   In the Component's directory, run MkRes
   (amu_machine resources RESDIR=<resource$dir>.Resources)
   to copy the Resources to the Messages module directory.
   In Sources.OS_Core.Internat.Messages, run MkRom, then copy the
   updated Messages module to Install.ROM.Morris.
4) In BuildSys.Morris4.ROMImage, run MkInstall


Building a 2MByte ROM image
---------------------------
This is sometimes required for hardware testing.

1) In Build root directory, run !Env
   - sets ImageSize to 2048K (used during Kernel build)
   - set Resources dir to be Messages2

2) Rebuild the Kernel (uses ImageSize):
   In Sources.OS_Core.Kernel, run MkRom
   Copy new Kernel to Install.ROM.Morris as Kernel2Meg

3) Create a (small) Messages module:
   Copy Sources.OS_Core.Internat.Messages
     to Sources.OS_Core.Internat.Messages2
   In Messages2, run MkClean, then remove UK directory
   In BuildSys.Morris2:
   - Check contents of Components file
   - Run !Config (to ensure that Makefile is up to date)
   - Run !MkRes (to copy Resources for each component to Messages2.UK)
   In Messages2, run MkRom
   Copy new Messages module to Install.ROM.Morris2 as Messages

4) Build the ROM image:
   In BuildSys.Morris2:
   If all components have already been installed in the Install
   directory, (e.g. by a previous Build for a 4MByte image) then
   it should be sufficient to run ROMImage.MkInstall.
   Otherwise, run !MkCpInst (this runs ROMImage.MkInstall as a final step)
   When complete, the image can be found in Install.Images.2MEG


Hints & Tips
============
Save the output generated in Task Windows by build procedures as log files
for future reference.
